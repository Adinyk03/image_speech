# image_speech
another basic program to covert a given text to speech and then take that speech and use it as a background sound for an image also given by the user. the text input and the image input is given by the user through an user interface made using the python module "tkinter"

# final output
first the text input is understood and converted to the speech form using gtts module. then using the "moviepy.editor" library, we create an mp4 file with the background music as the speech that was generated previously. here the final output is an mp4 file with the image as the whole video while the speech is playing in the background

#purpose
this is just experimentation to do the final nprject of mine which was the lip sync project.
